# MV-Components Support README

A simple package to enable basic autocompletion and switch between the MV-Component's python class and view files.

## Features

Once a MV-Component class or view file is open and active, just run the command `mv-components-support.switch` to switch between the two files.

Keyboard shortcut: `CMD + Alt + S`

Autocompletion is triggered by typing `mv-`. A list of all possible components will be generated as autocomplete suggestions. The list narrows as you type.
